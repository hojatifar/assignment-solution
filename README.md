python command line tool, that the basic requirements requested have been developed.

This tool needs the following developments to be complete in real scenarios:

- Using a nosql database in this case Redis is appropriate
  
- Configuration and development of input section to get logs from the log stash as a stream for huge logs
  
- If using parallel queues to send logs, use rabbit and develop the input part for thread
  
- Converting the operation part to object-oriented and building event(logs or stream) class and processing it in thread
  
- Development of the output section for different formats
  
- Real-time EPS implementation for traffic analysis
  
- And the most important part, if many rules are determined for the operation part, using a Business Rule Management System
